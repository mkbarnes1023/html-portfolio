 <h1>Best Movies According to Kenzie</h1>
 <h2>My Top Movies of All Time</h2>
 <hr />

 <h2>Jurassic Park</h2>
 <p>Steven Spielberg's use of super realistic animatronics & suits for the dinosaurs still holds up to this day, even to the newer movies with CGI.</p>
 <h2>Wicked</h2>
 <p>Even though they've only released the first part, the songs and compositions hold up to the musical so far.</p>
 <h2>Jurassic World: Dominion</h2>
 <p> Again, can't go wrong with dinosaurs, and the original cast being a critical part in the movie brings back such good memories of where it all started. Alan Grant's final "I told you so".</p>
